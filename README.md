Once Upon a Nugget

Made during GameDev.tv Game Jam 2021
The theme was "All that glistens is not gold."

All controls are made via the mouse.

Use the map to move from one location to the next and try to find gold nuggets. Simply dip the sieve into the water and shake it to reveal nuggets. You only have 60 seconds to complete the game. Good luck!
